# QuickDict

## Overview
QuickDict is an extension that helps to accelerate looking up Japanese vocabulary

## Functionality 
QuickDict makes it easier to look up any Japanese vocabulary or grammar you come across when surfing the web. You have the options to search for the selected text on Jisho, Goo, Takoboto and DeepL, an up-and-coming translation site.

You can also choose to save any vocab you want to review later, and display them through the extension popup.

## Motivation
Being a Japanese learner myself, I have found it repetitive and time-consuming to navigate to a new tab and typing in various addresses to dictionary sites before being able to learn the meaning of a vocabulary term, and thus want to make an extension to help not only myself but also other Japanese learners. QuickDict helps Japanese learners to streamline the process of looking up unfamiliar phrases and grammar when casually browsing webpages as well as allows users to save any vocab for future review.
